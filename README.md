# Big Integer Calculator


## Contents
*This respository contains the following:*
- README.md
    - This file contains the contents of Big Integer Calculator and what each file does.
- Arithmetic.cpp
    - This is the client module for the BigInteger ADT. It creates 2 BigIntegers based on an input file and performs 8 different operations on them, outputting the results.
- BigInteger.cpp
    - This is the implementation file for the BigInteger ADT, containing its constructor, destructor, accessors and manipulation procedures.
- BigInteger.h
    - This is the header file for the BigInteger ADT, containing all of the public function signatures and exported types.
- BigIntegerTest.cpp
    - This is the test client for the BigInteger ADT to make sure everything about the ADT is working properly.
- List.cpp
    - This is the implementation file for the List ADT, containing its constructor, destructor, accessors and manipulation procedures.
- List.h
    - This is the header file for the List ADT, containing all of the public function signatures and exported types.
- ListTest.cpp
    - This is the test client for the List ADT to make sure everything about the ADT is working properly.
- Makefile
    - This is the Makefile for Big Integer Calculator, useful for compiling Arithmetic, BigIntegerTest, ListTest, and memory leak checks for Arithmetic, BigIntegerTest, and ListTest.
